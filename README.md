# Solar-Panel-Placement-Optimizer

This project leverages satellite imagery and machine learning techniques to classify optimal solar panel locations. The solution involves data collection, model development, and visualization, providing insights for efficient solar panel placement.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on using satellite imagery to identify the best locations for solar panel installation. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to analyze roof orientation, shading, and terrain, providing recommendations for solar panel placement.

### Key Features:
#### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Utilize open-source satellite imagery data (e.g., Google Earth Engine, Sentinel-2).
Preprocess the imagery data to extract relevant features, such as roof orientation, shading, and terrain characteristics.

#### Machine Learning Model:

Develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify optimal solar panel locations based on the processed imagery.
Train the model on a small dataset of labeled images to identify patterns and make predictions.

#### Visualization and Reporting:

Create an interactive map to visualize the results and display the optimal locations for solar panel installation.
Generate a sample report providing recommendations and insights based on the modelâ€™s output.


#### Scalability and Future Improvements:

Outline a plan to scale the solution for handling larger datasets and broader geographical areas.
Propose additional data sources and techniques to improve model accuracy, such as integrating weather patterns or higher-resolution imagery.
